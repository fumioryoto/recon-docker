# recon-docker
A full-featured reconnaissance toolkit in a Docker container. Automates subdomain enumeration, DNS resolution, live host detection, URL collection, parameter discovery, and vulnerability pattern matching.    All tools are **pre-installed** and orchestrated through a single script (recon.sh). Perfect for pentesters.
